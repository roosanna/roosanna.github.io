      <h3>Hi, I'm Roosa.</h3>
      <p>I have been playing around with HTML and CSS since I was about 11. Now I'm hoping to use it earn a living!<br><br>
      It started so innocently. I used to play a web based game called Neopets (which is still around, incidentally) and a feature of this website is something called a user lookup. It is basically a profile page for a player, onto which you can add custom code. Over the course of five years or so, I spent a significant amount of time on designing and developing lookups for myself and for friends.
