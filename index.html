      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <h3>How it all started</h3>
      <p class="main">I first learned about the ketogenic lifestyle in 2015. It took me another few months before I finally gave it a go. Well, folks, long story short, keto really works. I used keto to successfully lose about 20 lbs. My partner at the time was less than supportive, but I stuck with it nevertheless.</p>
      <h3>Where I am at now</h3>
      <p class="main">Over the years I have been on and off keto. I would have periods where I would be strict, and times when I found myself eating all the carbs, not really caring, treating my body like a garbage disposal. I'm determined to change that, and to do it for real again. I have another 20 lbs to lose. Not much, I know, but to me it feels like a lot. I feel fat, to put it simply.</p>
